# DSA in Python: Linked List, Stack, Queue, and Circular Queue

## Description

This repository provides a single Python file containing implementations of essential data structures for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**: **Linked List**, **Stack**, **Queue**, and **Circular Queue**. Each data structure includes fundamental methods and example usage. This is a useful resource for understanding these data structures in Python.

## Data Structures
**Linked List**
A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, with each node pointing to the next. This implementation includes:

insert(data): Insert a node at the end.
insert_at_beginning(data): Insert a node at the beginning.
delete(data): Delete a specific node.
display(): Display all elements.

**Stack**
A Stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure. This implementation includes:

push(data): Add an element to the top.
pop(): Remove and return the top element.
peek(): View the top element.
is_empty(): Check if the stack is empty.

**Queue**
A Queue is a FIFO (First In, First Out) structure. This implementation includes:

enqueue(data): Add an element to the end.
dequeue(): Remove and return the front element.
is_empty(): Check if the queue is empty.
display(): Display all elements.

**Circular Queue**
A Circular Queue connects the last element back to the first. This implementation includes:

enqueue(data): Add an element if there's space.
dequeue(): Remove and return the front element.
is_empty(): Check if the queue is empty.
is_full(): Check if the queue is full.
display(): Display all elements in order.
